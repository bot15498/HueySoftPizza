New monitoring program
Today's client wants every profile  we have except those which contain old males who happen to be associated with anime.~~Today we are also testing our new monitoring equipment after some clients complained about unsatisfactory results.  We'll be watching for any mistakes, and disciplinary action will be taken as necessary. You will only be given one warning. After your one warning for the day you will be subject to pay dock or possibility of expulsion.
