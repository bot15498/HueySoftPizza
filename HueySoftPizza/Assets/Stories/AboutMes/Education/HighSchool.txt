I'm a kinda shy high school studentÅc (notice me, girl who sits in front of me in MAT230...)
Guess I'm still a lonely high schooler...
Math is really fun! I can't wait to graduate from high school and study at a university.
Man, high school cafe food really sucks...
Cant wait to get out of this dumb high school class
My teachers actually kinda hot, tbhÅc Too bad I'm just a high schooler.
Job interviews freak me outÅc Good thing I'm still in high school.
