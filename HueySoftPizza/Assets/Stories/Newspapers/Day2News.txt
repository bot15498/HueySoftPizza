Popular Online Game On The Rise
LONG
These days, it's not uncommon for people to be seen playing a game on their phone while they are out and about. These kinds of games are usually what people think about whenever a "game" is mentioned. However, this kind of game is a new kind of game. The game is called Fortnite, and can only be played on the most powerful computers on the market. The game consists of a static map, where individuals challenge each other to honorary duels in an attempt to prove themselves the worthiest of the Virgin King Crown. Fortnite also features online multiplayer, meaning that people from across the country or across the world could be playing and chatting as if they were in the same room. This is revolutionary for the gaming community and the online community as a whole.
