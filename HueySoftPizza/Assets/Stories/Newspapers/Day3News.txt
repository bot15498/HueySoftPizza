Electricity On Tetrick Road Suddenly Goes Out Overnight!
LONG
Last night, the power went for the Tetrick neighborhood. We apologize for all food that spoiled throughout the night. The electric company claims that the outage was caused by a surge from one of the residential houses on the street at approximately 1 AM. We are currently awaiting the resident of the suspect house to return home to ask further questions. In the meantime, we advise that all residents check their appliances for any electrical faults caused by the surge. (Food costs are tripled.)
